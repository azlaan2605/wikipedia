Theranos (/ˈθɛrənoʊs/) was an American <a href="#"> held health technology corporation</a>.[2] It was initially
toutedas a breakthrough technology company, with claims of having devised<a href="#"> blood tests</a> that required
only very small amounts of blood and could be performed very rapidly using small automated devices the company had developed.
However, these claims were later proven to be false.[3][4][5] Founded in 2003 by 19-year-old.Elizabeth Holmes,[6]
Theranos raised more than US$700 million from venture capitalists and private investors,[7]
resulting in a <a href="#">$10 billion</a> valuation at its peak in 2013 and 2014.[8][9]

A turning point came in 2015 when medical research <a href="#"> professors John Ioannidis and Eleftherios Diamandis</a>, along
with investigative journalist John Carreyrou of The Wall Street Journal, questioned the validity of Theranos'
technology. The company faced a string of legal and commercial challenges from medical authorities, investors,
the U.S. Securities and <a href="#"> Exchange Commission (SEC)</a>, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state
attorneys general, former business partners, patients, and others.[10] By June 2016, it was estimated that
Holmes' personal net worth had dropped from $4.5 billion to virtually nothing.[11] The company was near
bankruptcy until it received, in 2017, a <a href="#"> $100 million</a> loan from Fortress Investment Group secured by its
patents.[12]

In July 2016, Theranos received sanctions from the CMS, including the revocation of its <a href="#"> CLIA certificate</a> and
prohibition of Holmes and other company officials from owning or operating a laboratory for two years.[13]
Theranos announced it would close its <a href="#"> laboratory operations</a> and wellness centers to work on miniature medical
testing machines.[14] In April 2017, Theranos said it had reached a <a href="#"> settlement agreement with CMS</a>.[15] Following
the CMS sanctions, the Walgreens pharmacy chain terminated its contract with Theranos and filed a lawsuit
claiming continuous breaches of contract. The suit was settled out of court, with Theranos compensating
Walgreens for a much smaller amount than the claimed $140 million, reported at about $30 million. After efforts
to find a buyer went nowhere, what remained of the company dissolved on September 4, 2018.[16]

On March 14, 2018, Theranos, Holmes, and former company president <a href="#"> Ramesh "Sunny" Balwani</a> were charged with
"massive fraud" by the SEC.[17] One section of the complaint says Holmes falsely claimed in 2014 that the
company had annual revenues of $100 million, a thousand times more than the actual figure of $100,000.[18]
Theranos and Holmes agreed to resolve the charges against them, with Holmes paying a fine of $500,000, returning
the remaining 18.9 million shares that she held, relinquishing her control of the company, and being barred from
being an officer or director of any public company for ten years.[19] According to the agreement, if Theranos
were acquired or otherwise liquidated, Holmes would not profit from her ownership until more than $750 million
was returned to investors and other preferred shareholders. Theranos and Holmes neither admitted nor denied the
allegations in the SEC's complaint.[7] Balwani did not settle.[20] On June 15, 2018, the U.S. Attorney for the
Northern District of California announced the indictment of Holmes on wire fraud and conspiracy charges. Balwani
was also indicted on the same charges.[21] The trial was scheduled to commence in August 2020,[22] but it has
been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Holmes' pregnancy. Holmes' trial is currently scheduled to begin
on August 31, 2021[23], while Balwani's trial has been postponed until January 11, 2022.[24]
